## Our Mission

### "Define the industry standard for mobile application security."

This OWASP flagship project provides a security standard for mobile apps (OWASP MASVS) and a comprehensive testing guide (OWASP MASTG) that covers the processes, techniques, and tools used during a mobile app security test, as well as an exhaustive set of test cases that enables testers to deliver consistent and complete results.

<br><br><br>

## Trusted by ...

The OWASP MASVS and MSTG are trusted by the following platform providers and standardization, governmental and educational institutions. [Learn more](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x02b-MASVS-MSTG-Adoption.md).

### OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS)

The OWASP MASVS is a standard for mobile app security. It can be used by mobile software architects and developers seeking to develop secure mobile applications, as well as security testers to ensure completeness and consistency of test results.

Its features include:

- Unifies all MASVS categories into a single sheet
- Traceable via exact MASVS and MSTG versions and commit IDs
- Always up to date with the latest MSTG and MASVS versions
- Enables user to add more columns or sheets as needed
- Multi language

## Donators

While both the MASVS and the MSTG are created and maintained by the community on a voluntary basis, sometimes a little bit of outside help is required. We therefore thank our donators for providing the funds to support us on our project activities. The Donation Packages are described on the [Donation page](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/docs/donate.md).

**The OWASP Foundation is very grateful for the support by the individuals and organizations listed. However please note, the OWASP Foundation is strictly vendor neutral and does not endorse any of its supporters. Donations do not influence the content of the MASVS or MSTG in any way.**
