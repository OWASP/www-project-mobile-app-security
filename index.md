## Our Mission

### "Define the industry standard for mobile application security."

This OWASP flagship project provides a security standard for mobile apps (OWASP MASVS) and a comprehensive testing guide (OWASP MSTG) that covers the processes, techniques, and tools used during a mobile app security test, as well as an exhaustive set of test cases that enables testers to deliver consistent and complete results.

<br><br><br>

## Trusted by ...

The OWASP MASVS and MSTG are trusted by the following platform providers and standardization, governmental and educational institutions. [Learn more](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x02b-MASVS-MSTG-Adoption.md).

### OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS)

The OWASP MASVS is a standard for mobile app security. It can be used by mobile software architects and developers seeking to develop secure mobile applications, as well as security testers to ensure completeness and consistency of test results.
