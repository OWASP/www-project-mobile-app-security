## Project Roadmap

The current project Roadmap can be found in our Github [Project](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/projects/2).

This Github Project summarizes the status of the tickets we are working on for the latest milestone.

A list of the planned milestones are available in [Github Isses](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/milestones).

## How can I participate in your project?

**We are searching for additional authors, reviewers and editors.** The best way to get started is to browse the [existing content](https://b-mueller.gitbooks.io/owasp-mobile-security-testing-guide/content/). Also, check the [project dashboard](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/projects/1) for a list of open tasks.

Drop a us line on the [Slack channel](https://owasp.slack.com/messages/project-mobile_omtg/details/)) before you start working on a topic. This helps us to keep track of what everyone is doing and prevent conflicts. You can create a Slack account here:

[OWASP Slack invite](https://join.slack.com/t/owasp/shared_invite/enQtNjExMTc3MTg0MzU4LWQ2Nzg3NGJiZGQ2MjRmNzkzN2Q4YzU1MWYyZTdjYjA2ZTA5M2RkNzE2ZjdkNzI5ZThhOWY5MjljYWZmYmY4ZjM)

Before you start contributing, please read our brief [style guide](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/style_guide.md) which contains a few basic writing rules.

If there's something you really want to see in the guide, or you want to suggest an improvement, create an issue [issue](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/issues) or ping us on Slack.

## Where do you guys need help the most?

There's a lot of areas where you can help out:

- Writing original content, such as describing testing processes and writing test cases. We're all doing this in our spare time, which unfortunately means that things sometimes slow down to a crawl. If you're knowledgeable in some area and have time available, we'd be incredibly thankful to anyone who contributes, even if it's only one or two test cases.
- Reviewing content and giving feedback. The proper channel for questions and feedback is the GitHub issues system of the respective repo, contacting us on OWASP Mobile Security Project Slack Channel is another possibility.
- Developing tools. For example, we still don't have an automated way of generating checklists out of the GitHub repo.
- Contributing to auxiliary projects: There are various projects that we support at this moment, consider: the [mobile threatmodel](https://github.com/OWASP/Mobile-Threatmodel) project and our own [Hacking playground](https://github.com/OWASP/MSTG-Hacking-Playground).

## If I am not a programmer can I participate in your project?

Yes, you can certainly participate in the project if you are not a programmer or technical. The project needs different skills and expertise and different times during its development. Currently, we are looking for researchers, writers, pentesgters, developers and graphic designers.
Note that some of the people who contribute to our project have started without any knowledge, but kept on researching until they had answers that were usable.

## I contributed to the original Google Doc, but I'm not credited in the new version of the MSTG?

As we migrated some of the existing content, we did our best to backtrack the original authors and credit them appropriately. We also added a [revision history](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x02-Frontispiece.md) that lists all the authors from old Google Docs. If you are not on that list but feel you should be, please contact [Sven](https://github.com/sushi2k) and he'll fix it. Or better yet, re-join the author's team and start contributing to the new guide.
