## Authors

### Bernhard Mueller

Bernhard is a cyber security specialist with a talent for hacking systems of all kinds. During more than a decade in the industry, he has published many zero-day exploits for software such as MS SQL Server, Adobe Flash Player, IBM Director, Cisco VOIP, and ModSecurity. If you can name it, he has probably broken it at least once. BlackHat USA commended his pioneering work in mobile security with a Pwnie Award for Best Research.

### Sven Schleier

Sven is an experienced web and mobile penetration tester and assessed everything from historic Flash applications to progressive mobile apps. He is also a security engineer that supported many projects end-to-end during the SDLC to "build security in". He was speaking at local and international meetups and conferences and is conducting hands-on workshops about web application and mobile app security.

### Jeroen Willemsen

Jeroen is a principal security architect with a passion for mobile security and risk management. He has supported companies as a security coach, a security engineer and as a full-stack developer, which makes him a jack of all trades. He loves explaining technical subjects: from security issues to programming challenges.

### Carlos Holguera

Carlos is a cyber security engineer with many years of hands-on experience in the field of security testing for mobile apps and embedded systems such as automotive control units and IoT devices.

### Jeroen Beckers

Jeroen is a mobile security lead responsible for quality assurance on mobile security projects and for R&D on all things mobile. Although he started his career as a programmer, he found that it was more fun to take things apart than to put things together, and the switch to security was quickly made. Ever since his master's thesis on Android security, Jeroen has been interested in mobile devices and their (in)security. He loves sharing his knowledge with other people, as is demonstrated by his many talks & trainings at colleges, universities, clients and conferences.

## Donators

While both the MASVS and the MSTG are created and maintained by the community on a voluntary basis, sometimes a little bit of outside help is required. We therefore thank our donators for providing the funds to support us on our project activities. The Donation Packages are described on the [Donation page](#tab_donate.md).

**The OWASP Foundation is very grateful for the support by the individuals and organizations listed. However please note, the OWASP Foundation is strictly vendor neutral and does not endorse any of its supporters. Donations do not influence the content of the MASVS or MSTG in any way.**
