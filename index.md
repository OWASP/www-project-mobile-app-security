## Our Mision

### "Define the industry standard for mobile application security."

This OWASP flagship project provides a security standard for mobile apps (OWASP MASVS) and a comprehensive testing guide (OWASP MSTG) that covers the processes, techniques, and tools used during a mobile app security test, as well as an exhaustive set of test cases that enables testers to deliver consistent and complete results.
