# Donations

If you'd like to support the Mobile Security Testing project we'll be happy to accept your donations. You may donate 5, 500, 5000 (UDS/EUR/GBP) or any custom amount. Certain amounts allow you to opt-in for a "[Donation Package](#donation-packages)" (see below).

100% of the funds raised go directly to the OWASP foundation and allow us to ask for budget to fund our project activities:

- Editing and proofreading by professional editors.
- Graphic design and layout improvements.
- Improving our automated delivery pipelines.
- Acquiring new test devices if certain tests can not be executed on existing emulators/simulators/test devices.

**You may do an online donation directly from the OWASP website by clicking the DONATE button above.**

When you click on the DONATE button and fill in the form be sure to verify that it has the line:
"Publicly list me as a supporter of OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide"
